# What CSV handling is used for in data engineering
-   CSV handling is used in data engineering for importing, exporting, and processing tabular data. 
    It allows for easy data exchange between different systems and applications, as CSV is a widely supported format. 
    Data engineers often use CSV files to store raw data, intermediate results, or final outputs in ETL pipelines.


# One thing you found tricky
-   One tricky aspect of CSV handling is dealing with inconsistent data formats, such as varying delimiters, missing values, or special characters within fields. 
    Ensuring proper parsing and cleaning of the data before processing can be challenging, especially when working with large datasets or files from different sources.


# Notes on try, except and CSVs
- The `try` and `except` blocks in Python are used for error handling. This helps prevent the program from crashing when an error occurs.
- When working with CSV files, common errors include FileNotFoundError, ValueError, and issues with data formatting.
- Example usage:
    try:
        with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
            # process CSV file
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print('CSV file not found.')
    except Exception as e:
        print('An error occurred:', e)
- Using `try` and `except` ensures that data pipelines are robust and can handle unexpected issues gracefully.
- We practiced reading CSV files using Python's `csv` module and handled errors using `try` and `except` blocks.
- It's important to log errors and handle exceptions to maintain data quality and pipeline reliability.
