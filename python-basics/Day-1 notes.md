# Python for Data Engineering – Day 1


# What is a Variable?

**Answer:**  
A **variable** is a named memory location used to store data in a program.  
It allows values to be saved, reused, and modified during program execution.

In Python, variables are created by assigning a value, and the data type is determined automatically.

Example:
```python
count = 5
username = "JAEY"
