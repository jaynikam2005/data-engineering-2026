# Data Engineering 2026

This repository tracks my learning and projects as I prepare for entry-level Data Engineer roles.

Focus areas:
- Python for data pipelines
- SQL for analytics
- Data engineering fundamentals
- System design & scalability

Timeline: Jan - June 2026


what concepts felt easy?
I found the concept of variables and data types in Python to be quite straightforward. The syntax is intuitive, and the dynamic typing makes it easy to get started without worrying about declaring types explicitly.

What concepts felt challenging?
Understanding more complex data structures like dictionaries and sets took some time. Additionally, grasping the nuances of Python's memory management and variable scope was a bit challenging initially.

One thing that surprised me ...
how powerful Python's standard library is. I was amazed at the variety of built-in modules available for tasks ranging from file handling to data manipulation, which significantly speeds up development time.
